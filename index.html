   I am Shengfei Geng, an Associate Professor at the School of Mathematics, Sichuan University. My academic journey began here at SCU, where I earned my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics, and I have remained on faculty since completing my studies.

   My research is rooted in algebraic representation theory, a field that explores how algebraic structures—especially associative algebras—can be "represented" concretely via linear transformations on vector spaces. Within this broad area, I focus on two tightly-linked themes: 1. tau-tilting theory  2. Cluster algebras and their additive categorification  
   
  If you share interests in any of these directions, feel free to email me or drop by my office at the School of Mathematics, South Campus, SCU.
